# Revisiting 2021 Futurism Takes – What Aged Well?

**Summary:** Honest re-evaluation of my 2021 video-essay takes on SpaceX/Tesla (heavy Elon-focus), the simulation hypothesis, and Meta's metaverse ambitions. I'll grade each prediction, own where early fanboy enthusiasm clouded nuance—especially around Elon Musk—and surface the bigger lesson: technology's trajectory is shaped by *many* contributors and its externalities (good & bad), not one visionary.

## Structure
1. Cold-open montage of 2021 clips.
2. Segment per topic with THEN-vs-NOW split:
   • SpaceX / Tesla – hype vs reality, Musk fandom arc.
   • Simulation hypothesis – cultural resonance today.
   • Metaverse – where did Meta & the ecosystem land?
3. Self-grading scoreboard overlay (predictions, bias check, externalities).
4. Closing reflection on decentralised, open-source future making.

## Assets
* Pull quotes & clips from old scripts (via repo).
* Visual timeline of opinion shift (fanboy → nuanced).
* B-roll: open-source hardware labs, community projects.
* AI renders contrasting "single-hero future" vs "collective future" 2035 scenarios.
