# Solar-Powered Aquaponic Mosquito Fighters

**Summary:** Showcase my four indoor aquariums and new outdoor tubs powered by small solar panels & LiFePO₄ batteries driving air-pumps. Focus on breeding mosquito-larvae-eating fish (e.g., Gambusia) as a climate-friendly, low-tech vector-control approach.

## Checklist

- [x] Purchase/verify 4 × 100 W solar panels
- [x] Purchase charge controller, LiFePO₄ battery
- [ ] Install charge controller & LiFePO₄ battery bank
- [ ] Wire DC air pump + test flow rate
- [ ] Capture build time-lapse (panel mounting, wiring, tub fill)
- [ ] Record macro B-roll of mosquito fish eating larvae
- [ ] Create power-flow diagram overlay
- [ ] Design solarpunk lower-third template
- [ ] Publish GitHub BOM & wiring diagram
- [ ] Mention upcoming DSPACE "Aquaculture" quest line

## Context / Why Now?
Mosquito control remains an ongoing challenge in Bay Area neighborhoods; showcasing a sustainable backyard solution aligns with channel eco-tech themes while demonstrating how we can naturally prevent mosquito breeding year-round by disrupting their lifecycle in standing water.

## Key beats & assets
- A-roll vlog style walkthrough of each aquarium.
- Outdoor build time-lapse (mounting panels, wiring pump, setting up tubs).
- B-roll close-ups of fish eating larvae (macro).
- Diagram overlay of power flow (panel → charge controller → battery → pump).

## Cross-promo
- Link to GitHub BOM & wiring diagram.
- Tease future DSPACE "Aquaculture" quest line.
