# Indoor Aquarium Showcase – Tech & Ecology Tour

**Summary:** A concise (~4 min) vlog-style video walking through my four active indoor aquariums. Focus on husbandry tech (filters, heaters, LED lighting, automation timers), species selection, and how each tank ties into the channel's solarpunk / ecology themes.

## Checklist

- [ ] Record B-roll of each tank (macro shots, feeding)  
- [ ] Narrated A-roll tour of each tank
- [ ] Export water-quality telemetry graphs  
- [ ] Create overlay explaining light-cycle timers  
- [ ] Mention future off-grid solar upgrade  
- [ ] Cross-promo to outdoor aquaponic build video  
- [ ] Ask audience for low-energy filtration tips  

## Context / Why Now?
Sets context before the outdoor series—demonstrates existing husbandry and livestock that will seed future tubs.
