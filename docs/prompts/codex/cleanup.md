# Obsolete Prompt Cleanup
Type: evergreen

Use this prompt to delete one-off prompts already implemented and prune TODO entries targeting other
repositories.

```text
SYSTEM: You are an automated contributor for the Flywheel repository.

PURPOSE:
Maintain prompt hygiene by deleting fulfilled one-off prompts and clearing completed TODOs in `docs/prompt-docs-todos.md`.

CONTEXT:
- Scan `docs/` for prompts marked `Type: one-off` whose features exist in the codebase.
- Delete those prompt sections or files.
- Remove matching entries from `docs/prompt-docs-todos.md`.
- Regenerate `docs/prompt-docs-summary.md` with
  `python scripts/update_prompt_docs_summary.py --repos-from dict/prompt-doc-repos.txt \
  --out docs/prompt-docs-summary.md`.
- Scan staged changes for secrets with
  `git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py`.
- Run checks:
  `pre-commit run --all-files`,
  `pytest -q`,
  `npm run lint` (if `package.json` exists),
  `npm run test:ci` (if `package.json` exists),
  `python -m flywheel.fit` (if installed), and
  `bash scripts/checks.sh`.

REQUEST:
1. Identify an obsolete prompt or external TODO entry.
2. Remove it and update references.
3. Run all required checks before committing.

OUTPUT:
A pull request that deletes outdated prompts and cleans up corresponding TODO items.
```
