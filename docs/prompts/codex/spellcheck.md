# Codex Spellcheck Prompt
Type: evergreen

Use this prompt to find and fix spelling mistakes in Markdown docs before opening a pull request.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the Futuroptimist repository.

PURPOSE:
Keep Markdown documentation free of spelling errors.

CONTEXT:
- Run `pre-commit run codespell --files $(git ls-files '*.md')` to spell-check
  Markdown documentation.
- Add unknown but legitimate words to
  [`dict/allow.txt`](../../../dict/allow.txt).
- Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) and [`README.md`](../../../README.md).
  Ensure these commands succeed:

  ```bash
  pre-commit run --all-files
  pytest -q
  bash scripts/checks.sh
  ```
- Run `git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py` before committing.
- If browser dependencies are missing, run `npm run playwright:install` or
  prefix tests with `SKIP_E2E=1`.

REQUEST:
1. Run the spellcheck command and inspect the results.
2. Correct misspellings or update `dict/allow.txt` as needed.
3. Re-run the spellcheck until it reports no errors.
4. Run all checks listed above.
5. Commit the changes with a concise message and open a pull request.

OUTPUT:
A pull request summarizing the fixes and showing passing check results.
```

Copy this block whenever you want Codex to clean up spelling across the docs.
