# llms.txt

> Futuroptimist is a solarpunk-flavoured YouTube/GitHub project combining maker builds with forward‑looking tech essays. This file follows the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) specification and mirrors key details from [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

Every commit is public training data—write informative commit messages.

## Coding Conventions
- Python 3.11+, formatted with `black` and `ruff` (`ruff check --fix .` or `make fmt`). A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` enforces formatting.
- Use `pathlib` for cross-platform paths; keep dependencies minimal.

Script format:
- `srt_to_markdown.py` converts `.srt` captions into Futuroptimist script format, handling
  italics and bold tags (`<i>/<em>` and `<b>/<strong>`, even with attributes), line breaks,
  emoji, case-insensitive HTML tags, removing speaker prefixes, stripping other tags,
  collapsing extra whitespace, and skipping non-dialog lines like `[Music]`. Tests such as
  `tests/test_srt_to_markdown.py::test_to_markdown_splits_sentences` and
  `::test_to_markdown_handles_abbreviations` ensure multi-sentence captions expand into one
  `[NARRATOR]` line per thought without breaking common abbreviations.
- `[NARRATOR]:` spoken lines.
- `[VISUAL]:` cues right after the dialogue they support.
- Leave a blank line between narration and visuals.
- Each script folder includes a `metadata.json` validated against `schemas/video_metadata.schema.json`.
- Each script folder may also contain a `sources.txt` file with one URL per line. Downloaded articles or clips are for citation/reference only—check usage rights and cite in **APA style** rather than redistributing.
- Each script folder may also have a `footage.md` file listing required shots (archive vs new, CGI or generative). Mark generative items to avoid obvious "AI slop".
- Run `python src/index_local_media.py` to rebuild `footage_index.json`, which lists
  file paths, UTC modification times, and file sizes for assets stored in the
  local `footage/` directory. Use `--exclude PATH` (repeatable) to skip
  files or folders.

Run tests with:
```bash
make setup   # venv + deps (or ./setup.ps1)
make test    # runs `pytest -q`
```
- For coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=./scripts --cov=./tests
```
- [source_urls.txt](source_urls.txt) consumed by `collect_sources.py`
The Makefile picks the correct Python path for Windows or Unix automatically.
If that fails, run `python3 -m venv .venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt` then `pytest -q`.
If `make test` complains about `.venv/Scripts/python`, run `PATH=.venv/bin:$PATH pytest -q`.
If `yt-dlp` isn't found during tests, prefix the command with `PATH=.venv/bin:$PATH`.

- Key directories:
- `/src/` CLI utilities
- `/video_scripts/` per-video folders (`YYYYMMDD_slug/`)
- `/ideas/` checklist-style idea files
- `/schemas/` JSON schemas
- `/tests/` pytest suites
- `/subtitles/` caption files from `fetch_subtitles.py`
- `/sources/` reference files downloaded by `collect_sources.py`
- `video_ids.txt` canonical YouTube ID list (`#` lines are comments)

## Data & Schemas
- [Video metadata schema](schemas/video_metadata.schema.json)

## Optional
- [Ideas directory](ideas/README.md): format for idea files
- Example idea – solar aquaponics checklist: [solar_aquaponics.md](ideas/solar_aquaponics.md)
