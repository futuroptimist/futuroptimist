# Futuroptimist llms.txt

> A solarpunk-flavoured YouTube / GitHub project combining IRL maker builds (aquariums, solar, gardening) with forward-looking tech essays on space, AI, climate & sustainability. This file gives LLMs concise guidance and jump-off links for deeper context.

Futuroptimist is maintained in public; code is Python-centric with heavy automation planned (see Roadmap in README). Videos scripts reside under `scripts/YYYYMMDD_slug/` and ideas as checklists in `ideas/`.

Coding style is pragmatic and simple. Use `pathlib` for filesystem paths and keep third-party dependencies minimal.
Scripts embed `[VISUAL]` cues inline with `[NARRATOR]` lines rather than in a separate section.

## Core Docs
- [README](README.md): high-level overview & roadmap
- [Agents guide](AGENTS.md): repository structure, coding conventions, test commands
- [Runbook](RUNBOOK.md): production workflow checklist
- [Contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md): PR guidelines & Code of Conduct
- Tests live in `tests/` and cover schema validation and helper scripts.
