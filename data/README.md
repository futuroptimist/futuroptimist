# Data directory

This folder collects lightweight, shareable datasets that support documentation automation.
Currently it stores `prompt-doc-repos.txt`, the canonical list of repositories scanned when
updating `docs/prompt-docs-summary.md`.

Add only small, non-sensitive files that contributors can version-control.
