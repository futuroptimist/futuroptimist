# Futuroptimist

Hi, I'm Futuroptimist. This repository hosts scripts and metadata for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA-J-opDpgiRoHYmOAxGQSQ). If you're looking for the full project details, see [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md). Guidelines for AI tools live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

English subtitles are pulled directly from each upload using [scripts/fetch_subtitles.py](scripts/fetch_subtitles.py). Only **manual** captions are downloaded so transcripts stay accurate.

Test coverage is exercised automatically via GitHub Actions.
