Hi, I'm Futuroptimist. This repository hosts scripts and metadata for my
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@futuroptimist).
If you're looking for the full project details, see
[INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md). We manage Python dependencies with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); check the instructions for setup steps.
Guidelines for AI tools live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
The canonical Codex prompt for automated contributions is in
[docs/prompts/codex/automation.md](docs/prompts/codex/automation.md).
The automated tests run via GitHub Actions on each push and pull request and currently
reach **100%** coverage.
