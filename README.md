Hi, I'm Futuroptimist. This repository hosts scripts and metadata for my
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@futuroptimist).
If you're looking for the full project details, see
[INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md). We manage Python dependencies with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); check the instructions for setup steps.
Guidelines for AI tools live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
The canonical Codex prompt for automated contributions is in
[docs/prompts/codex/automation.md](docs/prompts/codex/automation.md).
The automated tests run via GitHub Actions on each push and pull request and currently
reach **100%** coverage.

## Map of the repo

**Navigate in three hops:**

1. **Setup** – Follow [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for `uv` environment steps and
   contributor onboarding.
2. **Run** – Explore the [Makefile](Makefile) targets for day-to-day automation; CLI helpers
   live in [`src/`](src).
3. **Test** – Execute `make test` (documented in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`) to run the full pytest
   suite with coverage.

| Category | Path / resource | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Apps | _n/a_ | Entry points live in `src/`; no standalone services yet. |
| Packages | [`src/`](src) | Shared Python modules and CLI entry points. |
| Scripts | [`scripts/`](scripts) | Operational helpers (e.g., prompt migrations, scans). |
| Data | [`data/prompt-docs/`](data/prompt-docs) | Lightweight reference lists synced with docs. |
| Docs | [`docs/`](docs) | Prompts, playbooks, and supporting guides. |
| Tests | [`tests/`](tests) | Pytest suite mirroring production helpers. |
| Pipelines | [`outages/`](outages) | Incident logs and schema describing stability. |
| Infra | [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows) | CI for lint, tests, docs, status updates. |

Prompt templates stay grouped under
[`docs/prompts/codex/`](docs/prompts/codex) with an index in
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). Video narration lives in [`video_scripts/`](video_scripts),
and multimedia assets are catalogued via the Makefile targets above.

> **uv cheat sheet**: `uv sync` installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`,
> `uv run pytest` mirrors `make test`, and `uvx <tool>` launches one-off binaries without
> polluting the virtual environment.

## YouTube Transcript MCP Service

`tools/youtube_mcp/` packages a transcript fetcher that powers a CLI, FastAPI microservice, and
MCP-compatible stdio tool. It normalises captions for retrieval, stores 14-day cached payloads in
SQLite, and preserves provenance via timestamped cite URLs.

- **HTTP**: `python -m tools.youtube_mcp --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765`
- **CLI**: `python -m tools.youtube_mcp.cli transcript --url https://youtu.be/VIDEOID`
- **MCP**: `python tools/youtube_mcp/mcp_server.py`

Example HTTP call:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8765/transcript?url=https://youtu.be/VIDEOID"
```

**Policy notes**: the service only uses `youtube_transcript_api` and the public oEmbed endpoint,
rejecting private/unlisted videos when signals are available. It never scrapes HTML or bypasses
authentication walls.

**Caching**: responses are keyed by video ID, language, and track type with a default 14-day TTL;
expired rows are purged automatically when accessed.

**Error codes**: `InvalidArgument`, `VideoUnavailable`, `NoCaptionsAvailable`, `PolicyRejected`,
`RateLimited`, and `NetworkError` map to consistent HTTP responses and MCP error payloads.

Status icons: ✅ latest run succeeded, ❌ failed or cancelled, ❓ no completed runs.
The unknown state is enforced by
`tests/test_repo_status.py::test_fetch_repo_status_no_runs_returns_unknown`, ensuring repositories
without completed workflows render `❓` instead of failing the dashboard.
