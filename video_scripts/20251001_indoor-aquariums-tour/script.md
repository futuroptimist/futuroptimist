## Script

[NARRATOR]: Well, it's time for another video—I haven't uploaded in four years. A lot has happened since then.

[VISUAL]: Supercut of news clips, trending memes, and an old shot of me promising "regular uploads soon" timed to the line "A lot has happened since then."


[NARRATOR]: but I'm back! Hi, I'm Daniel and you're watching Futuroptimist.


[NARRATOR]: Today I'm giving you a quick look at four indoor aquariums I've been tinkering with. Stick around to hear about my automation plans at the end.


[NARRATOR]: I started the aquarium hobby 18 months ago and have been improving these tanks ever since, while bouncing between other hobbies and spending far too many hours at my day job—but let's focus on the fish.

[VISUAL]: Collage of all four tanks in a 2×2 grid, then a rapid-fire montage of office work, platinum trophies and Steam achievements, a peek at my current OSRS sessions, several 3D prints (including hydroponic baskets), and quick clips of the backyard garden.


[NARRATOR]: This 20 gallon runs the Walstad method, with garden soil under sand and a tasty layer of mulm. It's full of guppies, snails, and microfauna like scuds, Daphnia, and moina. I tried cherry shrimp, but their babies became guppy snacks.

[VISUAL]: Flash the Walstad Method Wikipedia page.

[VISUAL]: Quick shot of the mulm entry on Wikipedia.

[VISUAL]: Macro lens close-ups of guppies, shrimp, scuds, Daphnia, and moina.


[NARRATOR]: Early on the water turned cloudy and even took on a strong green hue—likely a mix of algae and bacteria. After a lot of digging through forums, I learned that adding a deep sand bed could give anaerobic bacteria room to work, and it cleared up almost overnight.

[VISUAL]: Timelapse from green murk to clear water.


[NARRATOR]: I replicated that deep sand bed in both 10-gallon tanks. The one next to this big tank had been cloudy from overfeeding, but the extra sand cleared it right up. Now the sloped bed and new RGB lighting make it pop.


[NARRATOR]: Next is a 10 gallon where those original female guppies gave birth during quarantine, shortly after I acquired them at a local fish store. Their fry, now nearly adults themselves still live here while the adults moved back to the big tank.


[NARRATOR]: Another 10 gallon sits in the back with aquasoil, sand, and plants but no fish yet. It's been cycling for nearly eight months and will probably house my first betta in quarantine. From the photo you'd think I'm gunning for a top spot on /r/stressfulaquariums—this shelf won't be its final home.

[VISUAL]: Photo of the 10 gallon on its flimsy metal shelf.


[NARRATOR]: Finally there's a tiny 5 gallon that was neglected for a bit, so right now it only holds snails and microfauna. Because three tanks are lidless, evaporation is fast. I keep two five‑gallon buckets above the tanks and siphon water down with gravity.


[NARRATOR]: To show how each tank looks from the inside, I've waterproofed an Insta360 and dropped it into the water.

[VISUAL]: Slow shot of the camera sinking into the 20 gallon, followed by 360° footage of guppies all around.


[NARRATOR]: Next up, it tours the fry tank and that cycling betta setup.

[VISUAL]: Quick montage from inside the fry tank, then the betta tank.


[NARRATOR]: Even the little 5 gallon gets a spin—tiny but lively.

[VISUAL]: 360° clip from the 5 gallon.


[NARRATOR]: I top off those buckets often and check parameters, sometimes dosing with products like Quick Start. The guppies eat flakes, pellets, and live foods, plus the occasional pinch of nutritional yeast—mmm. I've kept guppies going for about 16 months now, but Daphnia cultures crash easily, so I'm experimenting with green water and leaf litter for stability.

[VISUAL]: B-roll of siphoning from buckets, adding Quick Start, feeding flakes and yeast.


[NARRATOR]: Long term I'd love to automate water changes and feeding with peristaltic pumps and microcontrollers, maybe even run everything off solar. The grow lights already follow a custom schedule through smart plugs, and my indoor tanks use PLA 3D‑printed baskets for hydroponic plants—they'll slowly degrade but that's fine. I'm also starting to work on some outdoor aquarium setups with similar aquaponic techniques, and work is well underway!

[VISUAL]: Photos of the aluminum extrusion frame for solar panels, the panels themselves, tubs of aquatic sand with plants, plus the charge controller and battery.

[NARRATOR]: Quick takeaways before we wrap up.
[VISUAL]: On-screen list: "Deep sand beds clear cloudy water", "Macro lens B-roll shows the microfauna", "Automation coming soon".


[NARRATOR]: What do you think of my setup? I'm just an amateur trying random things, so let me know if you spot mistakes or things I could do less stupidly. This is the roughest version you'll see, of course. Stick around as I level things up and make this the most reliable and robust aquarium setup I can imagine, and don't forget to subscribe!
