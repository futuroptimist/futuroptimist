# Footage Checklist

- [ ] Pull older photos from iCloud of each tank's early setup
- [ ] Review Insta360 clips for usable underwater shots
- [ ] Record new submerged footage inside the tanks
- [ ] Capture macro close-ups of guppies, shrimp and microfauna
- [ ] Grab B-roll of recurring tasks: topping off buckets, cleaning glass
- [ ] Note any CGI or generative AI segments â€“ use sparingly to avoid "AI slop"
