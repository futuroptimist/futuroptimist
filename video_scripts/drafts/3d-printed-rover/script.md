## Script

[NARRATOR]: What if your next weekend project roamed the backyard all on its own?

[VISUAL]: A palm-sized rover scoots over gravel, its orange chassis fresh from the printer.

[NARRATOR]: With open-source code and a handful of sensors, this rover maps the world like a tiny explorer.

[VISUAL]: LiDAR points trace a simple map on a laptop screen beside the rover.
