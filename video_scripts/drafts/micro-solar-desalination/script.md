## Script

[NARRATOR]: Fresh water shouldn't require a diesel generator.

[VISUAL]: A tabletop solar still glints under sunlight, surrounded by reclaimed salt.

[NARRATOR]: By using a tiny Fresnel lens and a few mirrors, this rig boils seawater with barely a handful of watts.

[VISUAL]: Cutaway diagram shows sunlight focusing on a black pipe while vapor condenses into a jar.

[NARRATOR]: It runs on scrap aluminum, 3D-printed brackets, and the same microcontroller that logs the output to an SD card.

[VISUAL]: Microcontroller display graphs the collected water over time.
