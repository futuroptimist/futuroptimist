# We're probably in a simulation because we make them already

## Script

[NARRATOR]: Are we living in a simulation? Maybe, maybe not.

[NARRATOR]: We are nearing an era where created realities rival our own.

[NARRATOR]: In this video I'll cover simulations we might build soon and why they're plausible.

[NARRATOR]: Many thinkers, including Neil deGrasse Tyson and Elon Musk, suspect we may already be simulated.

[NARRATOR]: As we produce higher fidelity simulations ourselves, the odds that we inhabit one approach certainty.

[NARRATOR]: I want to spur more discussion about this idea, though I'll save the question of whether we personally are simulated for another time.

[NARRATOR]: My inspiration comes from Nick Bostrom's interview with Lex Fridman and Isaac Arthur's video "The Simulation Hypothesis."

[NARRATOR]: This channel focuses on near‑future tech, and I expect most concepts here to happen within our lifetimes.

[NARRATOR]: We'll look at two kinds of simulations: ancestor simulations that model the past and what I call contemporary simulations exploring the present or future.

[NARRATOR]: There's overlap between them, but the distinction helps organize the examples.

[NARRATOR]: Everything here is hypothetical, yet I hope to someday pursue these ideas given the time and resources.

[NARRATOR]: Why might we create ancestor simulations? One obvious reason is entertainment—video games already give us a taste.

[NARRATOR]: Titles like Minecraft or Skyrim resemble simplified worlds with convincing agents, even if they're not conscious.

[NARRATOR]: Advances in AI and graphics will let NPCs appear increasingly human, perhaps even fooling us into believing they're aware.

[NARRATOR]: With technologies like physically based rendering and machine learning upscaling, these worlds will only become more realistic.

[NARRATOR]: If players use immersive VR or future brain‑computer interfaces, the simulation needn't render every atom to be convincing.

[NARRATOR]: This leads to the famous experience machine thought experiment—a device that can deliver any pleasurable scenario indistinguishable from reality.

[NARRATOR]: VR and neural interfaces could let us replay history, invent new futures, or even manipulate time perception so a lifetime passes in minutes.

[NARRATOR]: Such technology might mirror concepts like reincarnation or short stories such as "The Egg."

[NARRATOR]: Beyond entertainment, simulations help train AI. Tesla already supplements real data with photorealistic worlds to improve self‑driving.

[NARRATOR]: Humanoid robots would require even richer environments, potentially simulating humans themselves to teach complex behaviors.

[NARRATOR]: Dreams hint at our brain's own built‑in simulator, constructing scenes from memory or imagination each night.

[NARRATOR]: Simulated humans could also assist in interplanetary communication, standing in for us when light speed delays make real‑time chat impossible.

[NARRATOR]: We might even run parallel simulated societies as hedges against existential threats, capturing new ideas that bubble up to the parent reality.

[NARRATOR]: Those child simulations could spawn further simulations, forming a recursive tree until some limit is reached.

[NARRATOR]: That's a whirlwind tour of the possibilities. Subscribe for more videos on simulation theory and related tech.
