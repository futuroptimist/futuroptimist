# Futuroptimist Repository Guide

This document collects the full workflow for managing video scripts and metadata for the Futuroptimist YouTube channel. It mirrors the previous README content.

## Current State

1. **video_ids.txt** ‚Äì list of the canonical YouTube IDs for each long-form video (no Shorts).
2. **subtitles/** ‚Äì English subtitle files (`.srt`) downloaded directly from YouTube. Use the helper script below to populate this folder.
3. **scripts/** ‚Äì helper utilities such as subtitle fetchers.
4. **RUNBOOK.md** ‚Äì living production checklist covering the end-to-end video workflow.
5. **llms.txt** and **AGENTS.md** ‚Äì guidance files that help AI assistants understand the codebase structure, conventions and workflows.

> Video scripts live in `scripts/YYYYMMDD_slug/script.md` (auto-scaffolded). Idea files are collected in `ideas/` as checklists without date prefixes.

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (yt-dlp only for now)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download available English subtitles into ./subtitles
python scripts/fetch_subtitles.py

# 3. Run the full test suite (schema, naming, e2e)
make test
```
The script pulls **manual** subtitles when present, falling back to **auto-generated** captions as needed. Files are saved as `subtitles/<videoid>.srt`.

## Next Steps
* Automate enrichment of each video entry via the YouTube Data v3 API (publish date, title, duration, etc.).
* Convert `.srt` caption timing into fully-fledged markdown scripts.
* Build a lightweight RAG pipeline that indexes past scripts for rapid outline generation of future videos.

## üå± Roadmap / Flywheel Enhancements
The goal: turn this repo into a self-reinforcing engine that **accelerates Futuroptimist content velocity**.

| Phase | Feature | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  Plumbing | ‚Ä¢ CI action that runs tests + subtitle fetcher on every push.<br>‚Ä¢ Pre-commit hooks (black, ruff) | Confidence & code quality |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  Metadata Automation | ‚Ä¢ YouTube Data API sync to enrich markdown front-matter (title, publish date, views, tags).<br>‚Ä¢ Slug auto-generation + filename rename helper. | Less manual bookkeeping |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  Script Intelligence | ‚Ä¢ SRT ‚Üí Markdown converter that preserves timing blocks.<br>‚Ä¢ Semantic chunker + embeddings (OpenAI / local) into `data/index` for RAG. | Opens door to AI-assisted new scripts |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  Creative Toolkit | ‚Ä¢ Prompt library for hook/headline generation trained on past hits.<br>‚Ä¢ Thumbnail text predictor (CTR estimation) using small vision model. | Higher audience retention |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  Distribution Insights | ‚Ä¢ Analytics ingester (YouTube Analytics API) to pull watch-time & click-through data.<br>‚Ä¢ Dashboards (Streamlit) to visualise topic performance vs retention. | Data-driven ideation |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£  Community | ‚Ä¢ GitHub Discussions integration for crowdsourced fact-checks.<br>‚Ä¢ Scheduled newsletter builder that stitches new scripts + links. | Audience feedback loop |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£  Production Pipeline | ‚Ä¢ Adopt OpenTimelineIO as canonical timeline format.<br>‚Ä¢ Asset manifest (audio, b-roll, gfx) auto-generated from `videos/<id>` folders.<br>‚Ä¢ FFmpeg rendering scripts for rough-cut assembly and caption burn-in.<br>‚Ä¢ CLI wrapper `make render VIDEO=xyz` ‚Üí `dist/xyz.mp4`. | End-to-end reproducible builds |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£  Publish Orchestration | ‚Ä¢ YouTube Data API V3 upload endpoint (draft/private).<br>‚Ä¢ Automatic thumbnail + metadata attach from repo files.<br>‚Ä¢ Post-publish annotation back into metadata.json (video url, processing times). | One-command release |
